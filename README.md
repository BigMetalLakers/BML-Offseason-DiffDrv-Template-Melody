# Modification of MAXSwerve Java Template v2023.1

See [the online changelog](https://github.com/REVrobotics/MAXSwerve-Java-Template/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for information about updates to the template that may have been released since you created your project.

## Description
This code is retooled to make a differential drive train work with a template project for an FRC swerve drivetrain that uses REV MAXSwerve Modules.

Note that this is meant to be used with a drivetrain composed four Cimms with quadrature encoders, and a gyro.

## Prerequisites

Melody, the 2024 BML 6859 Robot from Cresendo

## Configuration

It is certain that this project will not work for your robot right out of the box.

These values can be adjusted in the `Constants.java` file.
